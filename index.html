        <h2>Meet Stephen Sweetser!</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineering student currently living in Manchester, NH.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working in the horticultural field, but have always had a love
          for computers and technology. I grew up learning to code but never thought to make it my career. Just recently I decided to change that and make a living out of one of my greatest passions.</p>

        <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>Additionally, I have more hobbies than my career and computers. They include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gaming</li>
          <li>Playing guitar</li>
          <li>Sports</li>
          <li>Learning new things</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After being in the horticultural field and working alone day in and day out, I've realized that I need a career that challenges me mentally and requires me to learn more and more every day. There is nothing I would love more than to be able to collaborate on a daily basis with a team of people - sharing thoughts and ideas - and to learn from them as much as I can. I feel like that is achievable through the career I am now chasing.</p>
